ABSTRACT

Cucurbit Powdery Mildew (CPM) is a prevalent threat to cucurbit crops globally, prompting the pursuit of resilient cultivars. This study aimed to assess the resistance of seven squash accessions to CPM through field screenings and subsequent analyses. 
Field trials were conducted to evaluated CPM severity on leaves, petioles, and vines of seven squash genotypes. The data exhibited non-normal distributions, suggesting a prevalence of tolerance among accessions. Visualizations, including box plots and ANOVA analyses confirmed significant differences in susceptibility levels among squash accessions, categorizing C_LUN and WBN-1-88 as susceptible, while PM_1, NH 148-15-6, NH_204_PM, OSA, and PM_2 was deemed tolerant to varying extents.
Regression models highlighted strong predictive relationships between leaf severity and petiole/vine severity across accessions, hinting at shared genetic mechanisms governing resistance or susceptibility. The study identifies potential squash varieties with varying levels of tolerance to CPM and underscores the interrelation of disease severity across plant parts. Further genetic investigations may unveil specific genes or pathways crucial for resistance, facilitating the development of robust cultivars resilient to CPM.

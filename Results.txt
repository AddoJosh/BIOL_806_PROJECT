RESULTS

1.Testing Normality of the data

The skewness for the leave severity severity was approximately 0.808 and Kurtosis was approximately 2.537 indicating that more values are concentrated around the center with heavier tails compared to a normal distribution, a possible suggestion that most of the squash accession may be tolerant (lying between susceptible and resistant). The Shapiro-Wilk statistic was  0.87069 (Pr < W = < 4.023e-07) confirming that leave severity scores were not following a normal distribution. 


2.Construction of Box plot 

Box plot was constructed to visualize the distribution of powdery mildew score on leave, petiole and vine of the various squash accessions. 
On leave, Powdery Mildew severity score ranged from 0 to 3 (as shown Figure 1 by the boxplot). The squash accession, OSA and PM_2 recorded the least severity score where as WBN-1-88 had the highest rating. Powdery Mildew severity score petiole and vine had a mean value of 0.0698 and 0.0930, respectively (summary data). 

3.Analysis of Variance to determine the effect of Powdery Mildew on squash accessions

To determine the effect of powdery mildew among the various squash accessions, ANOVA was performed.  
The analysis of Powdery mildew severity on leaves among the various squash accessions showed significant variations in susceptibility levels. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant effect of Powdery mildew on leave scores (F(6, 79) = 16.26, p < 0.001), indicating notable differences among the squash accessions. WBN-1-88 cultivar had the highest mean leave score, signifying a heightened susceptibility level (Mean = 2.425). Following closely, C_LUN breeding line displayed a substantial mean leave score (Mean = 1.183). NH 148-15-6 and PM_1 breeding lines showed similar mean leave scores (Mean â‰ˆ 1.042 and 0.936, respectively), implying a moderate susceptibility level. OSA cultivar and PM_2 breeding line demonstrated relatively lower mean leave scores of 0.308 and 0.175, respectively, indicating a lower susceptibility, also post hoc analysis showed that leave score of OSA and PM_2 were not different from each other. 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the influence of Powdery mildew on petiole scores among the  different squash accessions, resulted in a non-significant effect (F(6, 79) = 1.526, p = 0.18). However, distinct patterns emerged upon examining petiole severity scores across the various accessions. WBN-1-88 recorded the highest mean petiole score (Mean = 0.250).This was followed by C_LUN with a mean petiole score of 0.083. Conversely, PM_1, NH 148-15-6 and NH_204_PM breeding lines recorded mean petiole scores of 0.071 and 0.042, 0.042, respectively. OSA cultivar, and PM_2 breeding line recorded no powdery mildew symptoms on the petioles. 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the influence of Powdery mildew among the  different squash accessions, varied significantly differences (F(6, 79) = 4.166, p = 0.00109). Again, WBN-1-88 demonstrated the highest severity on vines (Mean = 0.417). This was followed by C_LUN (Mean = 0.167), while PM_1, NH 148-15-6, NH_204_PM, OSA, and PM_2 showed similar mean severity score (0.000). Pairwise comparisons indicated no distinct differences among the latter squash accessions in terms of vine Powdery Mildew severity.

4. Categorizing squash accessions based on severity score on leaves

Based on the severity score on leaves of the various squash accessions, they were categorised into three groups, namely, resistant (mean score of 0.0), tolerant (mean score of 0.1-0.9) and susceptible (mean score of >1.0). The results demonstrated that none of the squash accessions were immune to powdery mildew infection, two (C_LUN and WBN-1-88) were categorized as susceptible and five (PM_1, NH 148-15-6, NH_204_PM, OSA, and PM_2) were categorized as tolerant. 

5. ## Regression analysis and Model to show relationship between severity scores on leaves, petioles and vines 

A generalized linear regression model run on mean leaves severity score and Petiole severity score of all squash accessions (Figure 5) indicated that there was significant correlation between powdery mildew infection on leaves and petioles (p > 0.05). 

This graphic shows the intercept value as -5.4090, that indicates the log-odds of the response variable when the predictors are zero. The Leave_Score explains that for each unit increasing, there is an estimated increase of 1.7404 in the log-odds of the response. The significance explains that both coefficients are significant, with the p < 0.01, and this shows a meaningful impact of Leave_Score on the response. Model Fit shows that it fits well, due to the low deviance of 27.346 and a small AIC as 25.041.

This comparison between Leave severity score and vine severity score represented by the graphic above, shows that the intercept is estimated as -5.6902 and it represents the log-odds of the response when predictors are zero. Leave_Score shows that for each unit increasing, there will be an estimated increase of 2.06885 in the log-odds of the response. The significance shows a strong impact of Leave_Score on the response, because p < 0.001. The model fit shows that it fits well due to low residual deviance (32.119) and AIC value as 36.119, considered moderate.

This graphic shows values that prove that Petiole_Score variable has a significant influence. Intercepc value is -3.3761, and this represents the log-odds of the response variable when the predictors are zero. Petiole_Score shows that for each unit increasing the estimated increase in the log-odds is 5.8488. Both coefficients are significant, because p < 0.001, and this shows a strong impact of Petiole_Score on the response. And the model fits well because it has a low residual deviance (28.347) and the AIC value is 32.347, considered moderate.

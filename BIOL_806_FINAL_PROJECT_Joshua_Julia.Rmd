## Title: Screening for Resistance of cucurbit Genotypes to Powdery Mildew

# INTRODUCTION 

Cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM) poses a significant threat to cucurbits (Squash and Pumpkin) globally, affecting them in both field and greenhouse environments (Caligiore-Gei et al., 2022). It is mainly caused by two erysiphaceous ectoparasites, namely Podosphaera xanthii and Erysiphe cichoracearum (Lebeda et al., 2015). The former pathogen has a worldwide distribution than the later pathogen (McGrath, 2022). The disease poses a significant production problem, leading to a decrease in the quantity and quality of yields, mainly through a decrease in the size or number of fruit or a shortened harvest period, premature senescence of infected leaves, sunburn on fruit, premature or incomplete ripening, and poor storability (e.g., winter squash), low soluble solids, resulting in poor flavor (e.g., melon), poor rind color (e.g., pumpkin) and shriveled, discolored handles (pumpkin), and makes plants more susceptible to other diseases, particularly gummy stem blight (McGrath, 2022).

Powdery Mildew characteristics consists of conspicuous whitish talcum‐like colonies of the pathogen on both sides of the leaves (image 1), petioles and vines (Pérez-García et al., 2009; Caligiore-Gei et al., 2022). The pathogens cannot survive without a host, and under favorable conditions, Powdery Mildew develops fast and the time between infection and symptoms can be as short as three days, and spores are rapidly produced. Some reasons that can make infection favorable are high density of plants, low amount of light during cucurbits cycle, high doses of nitrogen fertilizers and high humidity (University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2021). Even though resistant varieties have been developed and improved worldwide to reduce the incidence of CPM disease, fungicides have remained the primary form of disease control (Del Pino et al., 2002). However, the use of these fungicides comes with ongoing challenges compassing prolonged exposure posing risks to human health, harm to non-target species (pollinators and natural predators), soil and water quality, pathogen resistance and also can be expensive, and their accessibility may be limited for some farmers (Cullen et al., 2019; Brauer et al., 2019; Ons et al., 2020).

In view of this challenges posed by overuse of fungicides and wanting a more sustainable methods of CPM control and management, research is being conducted in University of New Hampshire to evaluate diiferent squash genotypes for a possible resisitant gene against CPM. Therefore, the objective of this study seeks to contribute to the development of resilient crops that can withstand CPM, ultimately promoting sustainable agricultural practices through the identification of resistant squash varieties.




# METHODOLOGY

## (A) Field screening

The field trial was carried out during the summer of 2023 at the Woodman Farm (43°08′58″ N, 70°56′28″ W and Elevation 41.59 m) to test the resistance of 7 squash accessions (comprising 3 cultivars and 4 breeding lines) (Table 1) to Cucurbit Powdery Mildew (CPM). The trial was designed in complete randomized blocks, with 3 replications, each replication consisting of 4 plants. Summer Squash were planted around the fields and innoculated with CPM before the test squash accessions were planted. This summer squash severed as a source of inoculum of the causal agent of CPM. 

## (B) Disease assessment 
The assessment of resistance/tolerance/susceptible was made 60 days after planting when the disease was fully established in the field. Each plant was carefully evaluated and rated for severity on the 4th and 5th leaves, 4th and 5th petioles, and vines (main stem) using the scale developed by Caligiore-Gei et al. (2022) based on the percentage of leaf covered by powdery mildew colonies as shown in Table 1 and Fig.1.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

library(kableExtra)
install.packages("https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/4.3/knitr_1.45.zip",repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(knitr)

# Create a score data frame
Severity_scale <- data.frame(
  Severity.Scale = c("S0", "0% < S1 <25%", "25% ≤ S2 < 50%","50% ≤ S3 < 75%","S4 ≥ 75%"),
  Score = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  Description = c("No visible sign/symptoms of the disease","of leaf surface covered by conidia", "of leaf surface covered by conidia", "of leaf surface covered by conidia", "of leaf surface covered by conidia, chlorotic due to pathogen or dead" )
)

# Create a table using knitr::kable and format with kableExtra
kable(Severity_scale, caption = "Table 1: severity scale") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","bordered"), full_width = FALSE)
```

The mean severity score were calculated for leaves (4th and 5th leaves), petiole (4th and 5th petioles) and vine for each squash accession. Based on the mean leave severity score, the squash accessions were categorized as resistance/tolerance/susceptible using the following scale in Table 2.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
install.packages("https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/4.3/knitr_1.45.zip",repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(knitr)

# Create a category data frame
Score_category <- data.frame (
  Severity.score = c("0"," ≤ 1", " ≤ 2-4"),
  Category = c("Resistant","Tolerant", "Susceptible"))


# Create a table using knitr::kable and format with kableExtra
kable(Score_category, caption = "Table 2: Score category") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","bordered"), full_width = FALSE)
```




```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.cap="Fig.1: Schematic figure to guide the indexing of cucurbit powdery mildew severity on leaves"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ja1453/OneDrive - USNH/Desktop/Severity_image.png")
```




## (C) Data Analysis
For the analysis of the field screening data, statistical software R was utilized. The data obtained from the field trial, including severity scores for leaves, petioles, and vines of each squash accession, were subjected to a series of statistical analyses.
(i) Descriptive statistics, such as mean severity scores, standard deviation, and range, were calculated to provide a summary of the overall disease severity in the field trial.
(ii) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess whether there are any significant differences in disease severity among the squash accessions. This helped identify if there are varieties that demonstrate statistically significant resistance or susceptibility. Tukey's HSD were conducted to identify specific pairs of squash accessions that differ significantly in disease severity using the stats and TukeyC packeges.
(iii) Regression analyses (both linear model and generalized linear models) were conducted to explore potential relationships between severity scores on leaves, petioles, and vines using tidyverse and ggplot packages. This provided insights into whether the disease manifested similarly across different parts of the plant.
